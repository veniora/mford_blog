Chances are, if you're reading this, you have just participated in the bizarre biannual tradition that is daylight savings. Your schedule has been thrown off, your body clock is confused as hell and you are now hunting desperately for the upside to it all.

Daylight savings is actually great. (List some studies - lol bias much?)

There are two parts about daylight savings that aren't great. The first is the time jump at each end. It's jarring, it breaks our sense of continuity with the natural changes in season and it can induce suicidal depression in some. Personally I can expect 3 weeks or so of grouchiness twice a year as I can't wake up or get to sleep respectively. 

The second bad part is actually that daylight savings comes to an end. (Try and find research to support after school/work activities being more prevalent)

Since I aspire for my writing to be more blog than rant, I've made a thing.

Won't someone think of the children? - simpsons gif

Our kids (I say that despite being a youngish childless male), are getting pretty fat. They need to get outside more. We all do, the author who lies inside in front of a fan all summer included. It's a habit formed when young. Kids hate mornings but they love the evenings. Let's someone thing of the children (and the old couch potatoes they become) and leave the lights on an hour longer.



If you're anything like me, the next few weeks will be spent hunting for echo chambers for us to vent, bash our heads against the wall and generally agree, we just did something very stupid - *again*. 

I'm not going to list the reasons. You know them. Studies from universities and researchers clearly show how the purported benefits never happened and the toll on our poor brains is very real. 

Rather than that, I want to talk about sports. 



--- Plot out how the average start times of major winter sport events coincide with the sunset. Also show where average training sessions fit in.

Is it not bad enough that we have our kids out playing in the cold, the wet and the wind, must we also make them play in the dark?


--- rewrite this whole thing to 'dst is good for sports and for our health'. Remove the rant parts.
